My new site, hosted on Github.

I set up Jekyll with Bundler following [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/).

I followed [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to set up this site using Jekyll with GitHub pages.

Start up the development server using

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

...then you can see a preview of the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
