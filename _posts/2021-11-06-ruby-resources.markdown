I'm returning to some Ruby programming to learn Rails (for a while, I had been
exploring the node/javascript ecosystem)&mdash;I really enjoyed programming in
Ruby when I used it to learn some basic scripting for general computing stuff
(like processing text, doing exercises to learn computer science concepts), but
then stopped when I found myself mostly working in JavaScript.

This [Ruby Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ThibaultJanBeyer/cheatsheets/blob/master/Ruby-Cheatsheet.md)
has many concise examples of syntax and "idioms" of Ruby.
The social aspect of sites like Github encourage people to contribute to useful
resources rather than constantly "reinventing the wheel". 

## How do people work?

When using a programming language, it is helpful to see how skilled programmers
*actually work* with that language. For instance, do programmers really use a
lot of fancy debugging tools, or do they mostly rely on the equivalent of some
sort of `print` statement? Knowing what people that get work done really use in
their day to day routines can help you quickly become productive in whatever
language you're using.

Checking out cheatsheets like [this one](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/Ruby) can
be revealing of what commands people actually have to use often. For example,
by just reading a definition of the Ruby language, you wouldn't know about how
Gem works and how this is an important tool to understand if you want to make
use of other people's Ruby code.

By studying working code examples as well as the resources developers
themselves may use (e.g. cheatsheets to quickly familiarize themselves with
working with some new programming language), one can escape lots of the pain of  
discovering the limitations and problem areas of a particular programming
language by trying to build stuff up "from scratch"&mdash;this could be a
fun/useful thing to do to increase mastery of something but at beginning stages
with some tool, I find it is often helpful to just have something working to
start.
