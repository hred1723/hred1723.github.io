Visiting a place like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hred1723), you will most
certainly stumble across lots of talk about how much of the practice of
programming is searching through sites like **stack overflow** and copying and
pasting solutions found there, reading tutorials (maybe on places like
**Medium**, and watching **YouTube**.

You might similarly run into people talking about the importance of preparing
on sites like **LeetCode** to do *coding problems*, master *data structures*,
and learn the ins and outs of the syntax of some language.

Here we see two aspects of coding that go beyond knowing what is in the
language itself (which official documentation can tell you)&mdash;namely *how
do people actually use a programming language?* Naturally, this will also
involve learning about the ins and outs of some popular packages (e.g. Rails
for Ruby).

### Patterns
Sites like StackOverflow can show patterns that work for solving problems with
a language. Seeing how developers avoid or work around a particular error can
keep your projects moving. The goal here is to *not be original* but rather
find a working solution a more experience developer has successfully used.

### "Fluency"
Practicing doing coding problems is helpful to spend more time actually writing
functions, classes, and the like *rather than looking up stuff*. Once you can
do a lot of coding without looking things up, you have achieved a degree of
"fluency" in your target language.

There is a really nice feeling when you can think of some actions you want to
do (e.g. implementing the steps of an algorithm) and you are not hindered by
not knowing the syntax/mechanics of a language.

Many new developers have a hard time reaching "fluency" as defined above
because they may try to take on complex problems that are beyond their
understanding&mdash;for example by trying to "glue together" lots of third
party components.

Many experienced developers will astutely recommend *mastering the
fundamentals* (e.g. knowing how JavaScript works well) before trying to do
complex things using third party tools/packages/frameworks. Indeed the authors
of those pieces of software will have to know JavaScript (or whatever language
they write a package in) in order to fix bugs, add features, and so on.
