I found a website with some helpful tutorials for Rails things:
[codewithjason.com](https://www.codewithjason.com/).

The tutorial [A Rails testing "hello world" using RSpec and Capybara](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-testing-hello-world-using-rspec-capybara/) worked nicely with no issues.

## Thoughts about testing

For fast prototyping, writing elaborate automatic tests can be a lot of work
and really slow things down. I think getting a minimal working example up and
running like in the tutorial featured here is very helpful because it quickly
gives a working example to expand upon even if you aren't writing tests for
everything from the onset.
